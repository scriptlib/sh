#NAME
#       feh - image viewer and cataloguer
#
#SYNOPSIS
#       feh [options] file(s)
#
#OPTIONS
#       -h, --help
#            display help output and exit
#
#       -v, --version
#            output version information and exit
#
#       -V, --verbose
#            output useful information, progress bars, etc
#
#       -q, --quiet
#            Don‚Äôt  report non-fatal errors for failed loads. Verbose and quiet
#            modes are not mutually exclusive, the first controls informational
#            messages, the second only errors.
#
#       -T, --theme THEME
#            Load  options  from  config file with name THEME - see CONFIG FILE
#            SYNTAX for more info.
#
#       --rcfile FILE
#            Use FILE to parse themes and options from, instead of the  default
#            ~/.fehrc, /etc/fehrc files.
#
#       -r, --recursive
#            Recursively expand any directories in FILE to the content of those
#            directories, all the way down to the bottom level. (Take it easy)
#
#       -z, --randomize
#            When viewing multiple files in a  slideshow,  randomise  the  file
#            list before displaying.
#
#       -f, --filelist FILE
#            This option is similar to the playlists used by music software. If
#            FILE exists, it will be read for a list of files to load,  in  the
#            order  they appear. The format is a list of image filenames, abso‚Äê
#            lute or relative to the current directory, one filename per  line.
#            If  FILE  doesn‚Äôt  exist,  it  will  be  created from the internal
#            filelist at the end of a viewing session.  This is  best  used  to
#            store  the  results  of  complex  sorts (-Spixels for example) for
#            later viewing.  Any changes to  the  internal  filelist  (such  as
#            deleting  a  file or it being pruned for being unloadable) will be
#            saved to FILE when feh exits. You can add files  to  filelists  by
#            specifying  them on the commandline when also specifying the list.
#
#       -p, --preload
#            Preload images. This doesn‚Äôt mean hold them in RAM, it  means  run
#            through them and eliminate unloadable images first. Otherwise they
#            will be removed as you  flick  through.  This  also  analyses  the
#            images  to  get  data for use in sorting, such as pixel size, type
#            etc. A preload run will be automatically performed if you  specify
#            one of these sort modes.
#
#       -F, --full-screen
#            Make the window fullscreen
#
#       -g, --geometry STRING
#            Limit  (and don‚Äôt change) the window size. Takes an X-style geome‚Äê
#            try string like 640x480.  Note that larger images will  be  zoomed
#            out  to  fit but you can see them at 1:1 by clicking the zoom but‚Äê
#            ton.
#
#       -Z, --auto-zoom
#            Zoom picture to screen size in fullscreen (affected  by  --stretch
#            and --ignore-aspect).
#
#       --zoom PERCENT
#            Zooms images by a PERCENT, when in full screen mode or when window
#            geometry is fixed. If combined with --auto-zoom, zooming  will  be
#            limited to the the size.
#
#       -w, --multiwindow
#            Disable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead of opening mul‚Äê
#            tiple files in slideshow mode, multiple windows  will  be  opened,
#            one per file.
#
#       -x, --borderless
#            Create borderless windows
#
#       -d, --draw-filename
#            Draw the filename at the top-left of the image
#
#       -D, --slideshow-delay NUM
#            For  slideshow mode, specifies time delay (seconds, can be a deci‚Äê
#            mal) between automatically changing slides.  Great  for  presenta‚Äê
#            tions.
#
#       -R, --reload NUM
#            Use  this option to tell feh to reload an image after NUM seconds.
#            Useful for viewing  webcams  via  http,  or  even  on  your  local
#            machine.
#
#       -k, --keep-http
#            When  viewing  files  using  HTTP,  feh normally deletes the local
#            copies after viewing, or, if caching, on exit.  This  option  pre‚Äê
#            vents  this so that you get to keep the local copies. They will be
#            in /tmp with "feh" in the name.
#
#       -Q, --builtin
#            Use builtin http client to grab remote files instead of wget, use‚Äê
#            ful if you don‚Äôt have wget installed.
#
#       --caption-path PATH
#            Path to directory containing image captions. This turns on caption
#            viewing, and if captions are found in PATH, which is  relative  to
#            the  directory  of each image, they are overlayed on the displayed
#            image.  e.g  with  caption  path  "captions",  and  viewing  image
#            images/foo.jpg,   caption  will  be  looked  for  as  "images/cap‚Äê
#            tions/foo.jpg.txt"
#
#       -l, --list
#            Don‚Äôt display images. Analyse them and display an ‚Äôls‚Äô-style list‚Äê
#            ing.   Useful in scripts hunt out images of a certain size/resolu‚Äê
#            tion/type etc.
#
#       -L, --customlist FORMAT
#            Use FORMAT as the format specifier for list output.  FORMAT  is  a
#            printf-like  string  containing  image info specifiers. See FORMAT
#            SPECIFIERS.
#
#       -U, --loadable
#            Don‚Äôt display images. Just print out their  names  if  imlib2  can
#            successfully load them.
#
#       -u, --unloadable
#            Don‚Äôt  display images. Just print out their name if imlib2 can NOT
#            successfully load them.
#
#       -S, --sort SORT_TYPE
#            The file list may be sorted according to image parameters. Allowed
#            sort  types are: name, filename, width, height, pixels, size, for‚Äê
#            mat. For sort modes other than name or  filename,  a  preload  run
#            will  be  necessary, causing a delay proportional to the number of
#            images in the list
#
#       -n, --reverse
#            Reverse the sort order. Use  this  to  invert  the  order  of  the
#            filelist. Eg to sort in reverse width order, use -nSwidth
#
#       -A, --action ACTION
#            Specify  a  string  as  an  action  to  perform  on  the image. In
#            slideshow or multiwindow modes, the action will be  run  when  the
#            enter  key  is  pressed,  in list mode, the action will be run for
#            each file listed. The action will be executed by /bin/sh. Use for‚Äê
#            mat  specifiers  to refer to image info. See FORMAT SPECIFIERS for
#            examples
#            Eg. feh -A "mv %f ~/images/%n" *
#            In slideshow mode, the next image will be shown after running  the
#            action, in multiwindow mode, the window will be closed.
#
#       --action1...9
#            Extra actions which can be set and triggered using the appropriate
#            number key.
#
#       -m, --montage
#            Enable montage mode. Montage mode creates a new  image  consisting
#            of  a  grid of thumbnails of the images in the filelist. When mon‚Äê
#            tage mode is selected, certain other options become available. See
#            MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
#
#       -c, --collage
#            Enable collage mode. Collage mode is very similar to montage mode,
#            except the images are distributed randomly.
#
#       -i, --index
#            Enable Index mode. Index mode is  similar  to  montage  mode,  and
#            accepts  the same options. It creates an index print of thumbails,
#            printing the image name beneath each thumbnail. Index mode enables
#            certain other options, see INDEX MODE OPTIONS
#
#       -I, --fullindex
#            Same  as  Index  mode,  but you also get image size and dimensions
#            printed below each thumbnail.
#
#       -t, --thumbnails
#            Same as Index mode, but the thumbnails are clickable image launch‚Äê
#            ers.
#
#       --bg-tile FILE
#
#       --bg-center FILE
#
#       --bg-scale FILE
#
#       --bg-seamless FILE
#            Set your desktop background to FILE. Feh can use enlightenment IPC
#            if you are running it, or will fall back to X methods.  Feh stores
#            the  commandline  necessary to restore the background you chose in
#            ~/.fehbg. So to have feh-set backgrounds restored when you restart
#            X, add the line "eval ‚Äòcat $HOME/.fehbg‚Äò" to your X startup script
#            (e.g. ~/.xsession). Note that you only need to do this for  non  E
#            window managers.
#
#       -M, --menu-font FONT
#            Use FONT for the font in menus.
#
#       --menu-style FILE
#            Use FILE as the style descriptor for menu text.
#
#       --menu-bg BG
#            Use BG for the background image in menus.
#
#       --menu-border INT
#            Specify number of pixels that define the menu background‚Äôs border.
#            Borders are not stretched when images are scaled.
#
#       -N, --no-menus
#            Don‚Äôt load or show any menus.
#
#       -1, --next-button B
#            Use button B to advance  to  the  next  image  in  slideshow  mode
#            (defaults to 1, usually the left button).
#
#       -2, --zoom-button B
#            Use button B to zoom the current image in any mode (defaults to 2,
#            usually the middle button).
#
#       -3, --pan-button B
#            Use button B to pan the current image in any mode (defaults to  3,
#            usually the right button).
#
#       --no-pan-ctrl-mask
#            Don‚Äôt  require CTRL+Button for panning in any mode -- just use the
#            button (default=off).
#
#       -4, --menu-button B
#            Use CTRL+Button B to activate the menu in any mode.  Set to  0  to
#            use  any  button.  This option is disabled if the -N or --no-menus
#            option is set (defaults to 3, usually the right button).
#
#       -5, --no-menu-ctrl-mask
#            Don‚Äôt require CTRL+Button for menu activation in any mode --  just
#            use the button (default=off).
#
#       -6, --rotate-button B
#            Use  CTRL+Button  B  to  rotate  the  current  image  in  any mode
#            (default=2).
#
#       -7, --no-rotate-ctrl-mask
#            Don‚Äôt require CTRL+Button for rotation in any mode -- just use the
#            button (default=off).
#
#       -8, --blur-button B
#            Use   CTRL+Button  B  to  blur  the  current  image  in  any  mode
#            (default=1).
#
#       -9, --no-blur-ctrl-mask
#            Don‚Äôt require CTRL+Button for blurring in any mode -- just use the
#            button (default=off).
#
#       --xinerama
#            Enable/disable Xinerama support.  Has no effect unless you have an
#            Xinerama compiled in.
#
#       --screen-clip
#            Enable/disable window clipping based  on  screen  size.   WARNING:
#            With  this  disabled, windows could become very large, making them
#            unmanageable in certain window managers.
#
#       --hide-pointer
#            Hide the mouse pointer in full screen mode (useful for  slideshows
#            etc).

#
#MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
#       -X, --ignore-aspect
#            By  default,  the  montage  thumbnails  will  retain  their aspect
#            ratios, while fitting in --thumb-width  and  --thumb-height.  This
#            option  will  force  them  to be the size set by --thumb-width and
#            --thumb-height This will prevent any whitespace in the final  mon‚Äê
#            tage
#
#       -s, --stretch
#            Normally,  if  an  image  is  smaller than the specified thumbnail
#            size, it will not be enlarged. If this option is  set,  the  image
#            will  be scaled up to fit the thumnail size. (Aspect ratio will be
#            maintained unless --ignore-aspect is specified)
#
#       -y, --thumb-width NUM
#            Set thumbnail width in pixels
#
#       -E, --thumb-height NUM
#            Set thumbnail height in pixels Thumbnails default to 20x20 pixels
#
#       -W, --limit-width NUM
#            Limit the width of the montage in pixels
#
#       -H, --limit-height NUM
#            Limit the height of the montage in pixels  These  options  can  be
#            used  together  (to define the image size exactly), or separately.
#            If only one is specified, theother is calculated from  the  number
#            of files specified and the size of the thumbnails.  The default is
#            to limit width to 800 pixels and calculate the height as necessary
#
#       -b, --bg FILE|trans
#            Use FILE as a background for your montage. With this option speci‚Äê
#            fied, the size of the montage will default to the size of FILE  if
#            no  size  restrictions  are  specified.  Alternatively, if FILE is
#            ‚Äôtrans‚Äô, the background will be made transparent.
#
#       -a, --alpha NUM
#            When drawing thumbnails onto the background,  apply  them  with  a
#            transparency level of NUM (0-255).
#
#       -o FILE
#            Save the created montage to FILE
#
#       -O FILE
#            Just  save  the created montage to FILE without displaying it (use
#            in scripts)
#
#INDEX MODE OPTIONS
#       -e, --font FONT
#            Use FONT to print  the  information  under  each  thumbnail.  FONT
#            should  be  a truetype font, resident in the current directory, or
#            in feh‚Äôs font directory, and should be defined in the  form  font‚Äê
#            name/size(points). (No extension). eg. --font myfont/12
#
#       --fontpath PATH
#            Specify  PATH  as an extra directory in which to search for fonts,
#            can use multiple times  to  add  multiple  paths,  e.g  --fontpath
#            /path/a --fontpath /path/b.
#
#       --title-font FONT
#            Use FONT to print a title on the index, if no font is specified, a
#            title will not be printed
#
#CONFIG FILE SYNTAX
#       The feh config file allows the naming of option groups, or themes.   If
#       $HOME/.fehrc exists, or if not, but /etc/fehrc exists, feh will look in
#       it for theme name/options pairs. If neither $HOME/.fehrc or  /etc/fehrc
#       exist,  feh  will  create  a default one in ~/.fehrc.  An example entry
#       would be:
#       imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30
#       You can then use this theme in two ways. Either
#       feh --theme imagemap *.jpg
#       or you can create a symbolic link to feh with the name of  the  options
#       you want it to use. So from the example above:
#       ln -s Äòwhich fehÄò ~/bin/imagemap
#       Now I just run imagemap *.jpg to use those options. A cooler example is
#       mkindex -iVO index.jpg --title-font 20thcent/24 .
#       Notice the ‚Äô.‚Äô at the end. Now with a symlink I can  create  a  mkindex
#       command which will create an index.jpg in the current directory. I just
#       run mkindex to do it.
#       You can combine these themes with commandline  options,  they  will  be
#       combined.  So  in  the example above, typing mkindex -q will create and
#       index, suppressing error messages.  An example.fehrc is provided with a
#       couple of cool examples.
#

#MOUSE ACTIONS
#       When  viewing  an  image,  mouse  button  1  moves  to  the  next image
#       (slideshow mode only), button 2 zooms (click and  drag  left->right  to
#       zoom  in, right-> left to zoom out, click once to restore 1x zoom), and
#       mouse button 3 pans.  Ctrl+button 1 blurs or sharpens the  image  (drag
#       left  to  blur  and right to sharpen).  Ctrl+button 2 rotates the image
#       around the center point.  Ctrl+ button 3 activates  the  context-sensi‚Äê
#       tive  menu.   Buttons  can  be  redefined  with  the  -1 through -9 (or
#       --*-button) cmdline flags.  All you people with million button mice can
#       remove the ctrl mask with the --no-*-ctrl-mask options.
